            <p>Be sure to come to your local game store on armory nights to get to meet everyone and play games. People are always willing to let new players borrow decks so feel free to ask around.</p>
            <p>To talk with others outside of armory or ask any questions please join our discord. The discord is also the place for the most up to date announcements about armory events in case anything gets cancelled.</p>
